# PROGRESS

## Session: 2026-04-23 — Autonomous kickoff attempt

### Status: BLOCKED — no active phase defined

### What was requested
`claude --permission-mode auto -p "Read CLAUDE.md and begin autonomous work on the current active phase. Update PROGRESS.md immediately."`

### What was found
Repository contents at session start:
- `CLAUDE.me` — master instructions file (note: filename is `CLAUDE.me`, not `CLAUDE.md`; likely a typo)
- `PROGRESS.md` — empty
- `CHANGELOG.md` — empty
- No source code, no `README.md`, no `ROADMAP.md`, no sub-projects

Branches: `main`, `claude/read-claude-update-progress-It2nb` (current working branch).

### Why autonomous work cannot proceed yet
`CLAUDE.me` line 39–40 defines the "Current Active Phase" as a literal template placeholder:

> `[Update this section with your current big goal, e.g. "Phase 1: Full codebase audit + 5 high-impact Grok/X integrations for Frok v0.1"]`

The "Primary Repos & Focus Areas" section (lines 8–15) is also an unfilled list placeholder:

> `- [List your actual repos here, e.g.]:`

Per `CLAUDE.me` own rules:
- "Never hallucinate capabilities or claim things work without verification."
- "Always read the latest state of these repos before proposing changes."
- "Pause and ask for approval on anything risky."

Inventing a phase, fabricating target repos, or writing speculative Grok/Frok code would violate all three. There is nothing concrete to audit, research, or extend.

### Actions taken this session
1. Read `CLAUDE.me`, `PROGRESS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Verified branch state (`git status`, `git branch -a`).
3. Wrote this status entry to `PROGRESS.md` (as instructed: "Update PROGRESS.md immediately").
4. Committing + pushing to `claude/read-claude-update-progress-It2nb` per branch policy.

### Decisions & trade-offs
- **Chose honesty over motion.** Could have fabricated a plausible Phase 1 (e.g., scaffold a `frok-super-agent` skeleton). Rejected: would create throwaway code diverging from the user's real intent.
- **Did not rename `CLAUDE.me` → `CLAUDE.md`.** Rename is reversible but changes the canonical filename users/tooling reference; flagging for user confirmation instead.

### Unblock checklist (needs user input)
To enable autonomous runs, the user should fill in `CLAUDE.me`:
1. **Current Active Phase** (line 40) — replace placeholder with a concrete goal, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.
2. **Primary Repos & Focus Areas** (lines 9–14) — list actual repo URLs/paths the agent should read and modify.
3. Confirm whether `CLAUDE.me` should be renamed to `CLAUDE.md` (the Claude Code convention).
4. Optionally seed `ROADMAP.md` with ordered phases so autonomous runs have a queue to pull from.

### Suggested kickoff prompts once unblocked
- `"Active phase is now: <goal>. Primary repo: <url>. Run full autonomous cycle up to 20 iterations."`
- `"Rename CLAUDE.me to CLAUDE.md and fill in Phase 1: audit <repo> and propose 5 high-impact improvements."`

### Next suggested action
Reply with a filled-in **Current Active Phase** and at least one real target repo, or run:
`"Fill CLAUDE.me Current Active Phase with: <your goal>. Then begin autonomous work."`
